# Spatial Anchors Demo

This's a simple Augmented Reality Demo using Xamarin Forms, MvvmCross and Azure Spatial Anchors. It expand my other sample (https://github.com/roygarbriceno/ARDemo) by allowing the anchors to be persistent over time using the recent service on Azure.  

Was shown in my talk about creating persistent Augmented Reality experiencies with Xamarin Forms for the vOpen 2019 conference celebrated on Uruguay and later in other demos and presentations

It show a way to use a PageRenderer in each platform for initialize and use ARCore and ARkit, and setting up the Azure Spatial Anchors service in each platform. 

Sure, there're many ways of doing this, this's just one, I tried to document as mush as possible the code if you want to learn about AR and understand the demo

Provided "as it is", let me know if you find any issues with it or if you have any ideas on how to improve the demo
